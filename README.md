* Ensure you have the .NET6.0 Framework Installed(I used .NET6.0.402 For this Application) on your PC and you must have done the essential steps to at least writing a C# code in the REPL 
* If you're not interested in seeing the Build message, run the command: dotnet run, this builds and runs the application for you but if you are interested in seing the Build message carry out the 2 steps below
* Still in the Git bash Terminal, run the command: dotnet build --- THis builds THe Project and adds the essential directories to execute the application
